# SlimeUp
 Slime Up is a 2D mobile game with a level system. In this game, you need to use the parts of a slime to reach the finish point. Each shot causes pieces to break off from the slime, and if you fail to reach the finish, not a single piece of slime will be left. The game features a level system. November/2022
